# Please read me
## Recreation
### Just run every cell of exploration.ipynb to recreate the graphs
## Plots
### In the folder finals you can find all generated plots
## DATA 
### In the folder data you can find the csv files downloaded from etherscan.io on July 2022
### You can download and replace the csv's in data with the new csv's from etherscan.io
#### Do not forget to put all csv's , in case the tables are not the same length they will be concatenated with some auto fill
## Draft
### Here is the copy of unreduced source code, some more graphs and functions that could be helpful in further exploration but are irrelevant for the report
